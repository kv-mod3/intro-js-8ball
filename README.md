# intro-js-8ball

To-Do Notes:
- Implement Flexbox CSS.
- Add a Try Again button.
- Add waiting text.
- Want to see if I can implement alt text for each image for screen readers.
- I want to see if I can try making another function that autobuilds the array by adding a random integer onto the strings, will have to do later. (Maybe For loop?)
- add question mark to input validation
